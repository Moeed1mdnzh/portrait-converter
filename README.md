# image-to-portrait-converter

This project is supposed to convert your images to cool portraits using python.
The whole process will take some seconds to respond and give you the results and it
basically depends on your system components.The way that this works is that it segments your
image into different parts and it calculates the mean of each part of the specific segmentation and 
sets the mean to all the pixels to that segmentation.By the way,this program will want you to enter the
path of your image as an input.
